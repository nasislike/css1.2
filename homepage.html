            <p class="provide">
                Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. 
                It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!</p>
            <p class="reaction">Here How it works:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ol">
            <ol class="heat">
                <li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
                <li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
                <li>Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.”</li>
